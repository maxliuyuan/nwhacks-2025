  "feedback": "1. Session Overview\n\nToday, we focused on teaching you how to perform addition in assembly language. We discussed the steps involved in adding two numbers using registers and provided a practical example in x86 assembly.\n\n2. Key Takeaways\n\nUnderstanding how to use registers for arithmetic operations is crucial in assembly programming. The example demonstrated how to move values into registers and perform addition effectively.\n\n3. Next Steps\n\nTry writing a few assembly programs that perform different arithmetic operations. Experiment with adding more than two numbers and using different registers. Consider looking into resources that cover assembly language syntax and operations in depth.\n\n4. Performance Feedback\n\nStrengths: You showed curiosity and engagement by asking questions about the process. Improvement: Work on clarifying your questions to ensure you get the most out of the session.\n\n5. Encouragement\n\nGreat job today! Learning assembly can be challenging, but you're making progress. Keep practicing, and remember, every little step counts! Quack on!"
